# How to Use a Prolific USB to Serial Sim Card Reader
 
A sim card reader is a device that allows you to access the data stored on your sim card, such as contacts, messages, and network information. A Prolific USB to serial sim card reader is a type of sim card reader that connects to your computer via a USB port and uses a serial interface to communicate with your sim card. This article will show you how to use a Prolific USB to serial sim card reader with some common applications.
 
## What You Need
 
- A Prolific USB to serial sim card reader. You can find various models from different vendors that use the Prolific chipset, such as AP1103[^1^], MA8170[^2^], or Plugable[^3^]. Make sure you have the correct driver installed for your device.
- A sim card that you want to read. You can use any standard sim card from any network provider.
- A computer with a USB port and an operating system that supports the Prolific driver. You can use Windows, Mac OS, Linux, or Android.
- An application that can read and write data from your sim card. You can use any software that supports the AT commands for sim cards, such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY, SIM Card Manager, or SIM Explorer.

## How to Use

1. Connect your Prolific USB to serial sim card reader to your computer's USB port. You should see a new device appear in your device manager or system settings.
2. Open your application of choice and configure it to use the correct serial port and baud rate for your device. The default baud rate for most Prolific devices is 9600 bps.
3. Send an AT command to test the connection with your sim card reader. For example, you can send `AT` and expect to receive `OK` as a response.
4. Send other AT commands to read and write data from your sim card. For example, you can send `AT+CPBR=1` to read the first contact from your phonebook, or `AT+CMGR=1` to read the first message from your inbox.
